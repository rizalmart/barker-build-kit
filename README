This tools allows to build debian-based puppy from scratch.

folders:
external-tools - tools will be used for processing the main puppy sfs
puppy-rootfs-template - the puppy skeletal filesystem
livecd-files - boot files used to build the live cd 
puppy-source-builds - build scripts used for compiling puppy core applications. 

1. To use this build kit. you must to run the script step-by-step.
2. Before running the script you must configure it first by tinkering the following files:
   a. build-settings.cfg - build configuration
   b. packages.list - list of packages to be installed and part of main puppy sfs (NOTE: the package names must follow the debian package naming scheme.)
   c. a/b/g/n/x/ydrv-packages.list - list of packages to be installed and part of a/b/g/n/x/ydrv sfs (NOTE: the package names must follow the debian package naming scheme.)
   d. DISTRO_SPECS - the information about the puppy to be build
   e. mimeapps.list - list of file associations by default
3. Optional step: after step 1 script finished and before running step 2. Use chroot to apply some system settings or put some config files on build-rootfs folder.
4. Before reaching the final process and build the live cd. The following process must performed
   a. obtain the kernel, zdrv modules, and fdrv modules
   b. place it on puppy-livecd-build folder and rename it to its corresponding names as described in DISTRO SPECS
5. Run 05-build-livecd.sh to finally build the livecd.

NOTE:
1. barker heavily depends on the upstream package manager auto dependency resolution. Add missing packages on packages.list file when necessary
2. If compile apps from source is needed. craft a build script around the upstream distro and place it on puppy-source-builds folder
