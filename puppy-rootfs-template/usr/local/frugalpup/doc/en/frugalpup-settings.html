<img class="center" src="frugalpup-settings.png" alt="FrugalPup settings screen">

<p>The top part of the screen provides an opportunity to enable or disable the showing of optional advanced didalogs in the <b>Puppy</b> facility.</p>

<p>The middle part of the screen provides an opportunity to enable or disable <b>AUTOSAVE</b>.<br />
If the Puppy being installed supports <b>AUTOSAVE</b>;<br />
With <b>AUTOSAVE</b>, when you select "SAVE" on first-shutdown, and your save partition is either a "Linux" partition or "fat32" partition,<br />
there will be no further dialogs, the "save" will be setup and proceed automatically.<br />
If it is a "Linux" partition, a savefolder will be created, if it is a "fat32" partition the RW layer in RAM will be archived and then restored on next boot (pupmode=66).<br />
If <b>AUTOSAVE</b> is not supported by the Puppy being installed it will simply be ignored, "normal" first-shutdown dialogs will be shown.</p>

<p>The bottom part of the screen controls the appearance of "kernel boot parameters" in the "Kernel boot parameters" dialog of the <b>Puppy</b> facility.<br />
And the "kernel boot parameters" that are automatically applied by <b>StickPup</b>, <b>f2StickPup</b> and <b>DiskPup</b></p>

<p>"Web page, documentation of available Kernel boot parameters" is a button.<br />
Click on it to open a web page documenting "The kernel’s command-line parameters", i.e. "kernel boot parameters".</p>

<h3>"kernel boot parmaters" in default lists</h3>

<p><b>acpi_osi=Linux</b><br />
BIOS's usually disable functionality if Windows is not detected.<br />
By default the kernel responds Windows when asked if Linux is running.<br />
acpi_osi=Linux tells the kernel to respond Linux.<br />
Bios workarounds for Windows can cause unnecessary performance penalities and other problems for all later Linux versions.</p>

<p><b>libata.noacpi=1</b><br />
This may fix some problems with older or incompatible Bios / UEFI unable to resume correctly from suspend.<br />
Very often this also turns ACPI off.<br />
However, disabled acpi is not recommended, because ACPI is to communicate with the hardware.<br />
Especially in laptops (to turn off, to change the brightness, to change the volume).</p>

<p><b>intel_pstate=disable</b><br />
Intel processors by default use cpu-frequency scaling driver intel_pstate.<br />
It only supports powersave and performance frequency-scaling-governor.<br />
Use this to allow other frequency-scaling-governors to be used.<br />
However, this may affect newer Intel processors in ways you do not want affected.</p>

<p><b>net.ifnames=0</b><br />
Make predictable network interface names work consistently.<br />
If you want to default to using the old method (i.e. "eth0").<br />
The Linux kernel may default to using predictable network interface names (i.e. "p4p1").</p>
